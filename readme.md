# Projects for Junior Python Developers

This project contains [11 project ideas from an article at freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-junior-developers/). The code is all mine although it may be similar to others given the simplicity of the projects. [Most of the scripts require the PyInputPlus module](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/) to function properly.
 
## Odd or even

Welcome a user then ask them for a number between 1 and 1000. When the user gives you the number, you check if it's odd or even and then you print a message letting them know.

## Mad-libs game

Ask the user for an input. This could be anything such as a name, an adjective, a pronoun or even an action. Once you get the input, you can rearrange it to build up your own story.

##  Word count

Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.

Extra credit: open a text file that is pass in as argument, count the number of words in there and print out the sum total.

## Biography Info

Ask a user for their personal information one question at a time. Then check that the information they entered is valid. Finally, print a summary of all the information they entered back to them.

## What's my acronym?

Ask the user to enter the full meaning of an organization or concept and you'll provide the acronym to the user. Examples:

- input -> `As Soon As Possible` output -> `ASAP`
- input -> `World Health Organization` output -> `WHO`
- input -> `Absent Without Leave` output -> `AWOL`

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

Program a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

## Guess the number

You ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 50. If they guess outside that range, you prompt with an error encouraging them to choose a number within the proper range.

## Is it a palindrome?

Ask the user for give you five words. Then check if any of the five words is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that remains the same whether it's read forward or backward.

##  Calculate the tip

Your goal is to find out exactly how much tip you should give after receiving a service. In this scenario, ask for the total bill. Then display the tip for 18%, 20%, and 25%.

##  Email slicer

Collect an email address from the user and then find out if the user has a custom domain name or a popular domain name. For example:

- input: `mary.jane@gmail.com`
  - output: `Hi Mary, your email is registered with Google. That's a really popular email provider!`
- input: `peter.pan@myfantasy.com`
  - output: `Hey peter, looks like you've got a special domani for your email. That's cool!`

## Lyrics generator

Ask a user to choose from a list of 10 songs. Print out the lyrics to the song they selected. To take things a step further, have at least 3 songs by each artists. Ask the user to choose from a list of artists, then present them with a song choice.
