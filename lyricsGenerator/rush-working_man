"Working Man" by Rush
Music and Lyrics: Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson

I get up at seven, yeah,
and I go to work at nine.
I got no time for livin’.
Yes, I’m workin’ all the time.

It seems to me
I could live my life
a lot better than I think I am.
I guess that’s why they call me,
they call me the workin’ man.

They call me the workin’ man.
I guess that’s what I am.

I get home at five o’clock,
and I take myself out a nice, cold beer.
Always seem to be wond’rin’
why there’s nothin’ goin’ down here.

It seems to me
I could live my life
a lot better than I think I am.
I guess that’s why they call me,
they call me the workin’ man.

They call me the workin’ man.
I guess that’s what I am.

Well they call me the workin’ man.
I guess that’s what I am.
