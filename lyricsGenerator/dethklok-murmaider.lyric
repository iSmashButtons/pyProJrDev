All you need are instruments of pain

You need your:
Knives? Check
Rope? Check

Hold your breath, swim and strain
Smell the deth, can't escape
Blood will cloud and drift away
Attract the murders of mermaids
It's so cold, they all know
What you've done, you can't run
Vengeance is the law for thee
A thousand leagues below the sea

You've been tracked, you've been seen
Murdering the next of kin
Ate their hearts, drank their blood
Washed your fins in blackened mud
Try to swim, try to hide
Heart beats faster from inside
Thought it was a big charade
Your life is ended by mermaids

Murder! Murder, mermaid murder!

You've been tracked, you've been seen
Murdering the next of kin
Ate their hearts, drank their blood
Washed your fins in blackened mud
Try to swim, try to hide
Heart beats faster from inside
Thought it was a big charade
Your life is ended by mermaids

Your life was ended by mermaids
Your life was ended by mermaids
