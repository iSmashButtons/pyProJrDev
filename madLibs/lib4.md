# Political Speech

Ladies and gentlemen, on this `adjective` occasion it is a privilege to address such a/an `adjective`-looking group of `plural noun`. I can tell from your smiling `plural noun` that you will support my `adjective` program in the coming election. I promise that, if elected, there will be a/an `noun` in every `noun` and two `plural noun` in every garage. I want to warn you against my `adjective` opponent, Mr. `name`. The man is nothing but a/an `adjective` `noun`. He has a/an `adjective` character and is working `body part` in `noun` with the criminal element. If elected, I promise to eliminate vice. I will keep the `plural noun` off the city's streets. I will keep crooks from dipping their `body part` in the public till. I promise you `adjective` government, `adjective` taxes, and `adjective` schools.
