# It Was A Good Day

Just waking up in the `time of day`, gotta thank `famous person`,  
I don't know, but today seems kinda `adjective`,
no `sound` from the `animal`, no smog,
and momma cooked a breakfast with no `animal`.
I got my grub on, but didn't `animal`-out.
Finally got a call from a girl I want to `verb`.
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door,
thinking, will I live to see another `racial slur`?
I gotta go 'cause I got me a `noun`
and if I hit the switch I can make the ass `verb`.
Had to stop at `store`; looking in the mirror, not a `racial slur` in sight.
And everything is `adjective`.
I got a beep from `female celebrity`, and she can `verb` all night.
Calling up the `nationality` and I'm asking y'all:
"Which park are y'all playing `game`?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble,
last week `verb ending in "ed"` around and got a triple-double.
Freaking niggas every way like `famous athlete`,
I can't believe today was a `adjective` day.
