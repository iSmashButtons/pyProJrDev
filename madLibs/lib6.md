# Dining Room Wars

Our dining `noun` used to be a war `noun`. I thought the battles about correct table `plural noun` would never end. It was us kids versus Mom, and it seemed like a fight that would last to the `adjective` end. But tonight Dad finally declared a/an `adjective` truce, and we negotiated a/an `adjective` peace `noun`. Mom promised to no longer get `adverb` upset and shoot us dirty `plural noun` and make `adjective` remarks when we do `adjective` things she doesn't like. We in turn agreed to:

1. Use napkins to wipe out `body part` and not our `plural noun`.
2. Keep out `body part` off the table.
3. Not use our `body part` to pick up `plural noun` from our plates - except for sandwiches or pieces of `noun`.
4. Never talk with food in our `body part`.
