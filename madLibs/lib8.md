# Amusement Parks

An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer `noun`. When you get there, you can wear your `article of clothing` and go for a swim. And there are lots of `adjective` things to eat. You can start off with a/an `adjective`-dog on a/an `noun` with mustard, relish, and `plural noun` on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of `noun` with a nice `adjective` slice of `type of food` and a big bottle of cold `type of liquid`. When you are full, it's time to go on the roller coaster, which should settle your `body part`. Other amusement part rides are the bumper cars, which have little `plural noun` that you drive and run into other `plural noun`, and the merry-go-round, where you can sit on a big `animal` and try to grab the gold `noun` as you ride past it.
